# Search API Recombee

## INTRODUCTION

This module provides a Recombee backend for the
[Search API](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api) module.

The backend uses the [Recombee](https://www.recombee.com/) SaaS personalization
engine for indexing content. It has great performance, is suitable even for use
on large commercial websites.

The Search API backend does not support facets or searching. It is useful just
for indexing content into Recombee, improving the recommendations it is able to
make. The backend is capable of indexing more than one site, allowing for
federated recommendations across multiple Drupal sites.
